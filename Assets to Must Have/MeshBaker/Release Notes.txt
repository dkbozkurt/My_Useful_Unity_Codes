=================
Version 3.33.0 Feb 18, 2021
    Mesh Baker works with Addressables when materials are baked in the editor but Meshes are baked at runtime and loaded from bundles. This
    had been a problem because materials in the TextureBakeResult wouldn't map to rectangles in the atlas.
    Switched serialized path in the BoneWeightCopier to be Assets folder relative and standardized path browsing UI.
    Example scenes work better with HDRP and URP. There is now a script that will detect the pipeline and auto update each example scene.

    Better handling for linear color space projects.
    Added TextureBlenderURP for the Universal Render Pipeline/Lit shader
    Improved collecting texture properties from result material. Was using the Material
    API which was bad because it remembers extra properties from old shaders if the shader
    is switched. Now collect the texture properties using the Shader API instead.
    Bug Fix: Fixed some bugs in the the Standard shader texture blenders.
    Bug Fix: NRE when trying to use listShadersInScene and with split into groups.
    Bug Fix: When trying to combine skinned mesh renderers that are not prefab instances,
        bones would not always be copied correctly to the prefab. Fixed.

- Made method names more consistant
- More code is shared between MeshBakerCommon and subclasses
- Mesh combiners inherit from a proper superclass
- Handles objects with negative scale
- MeshCombiner now handles creation and storing of ResultSceneObject

======================
Version 2.11.8

- Fixed bug with BuildSceneObject so it sets the targetRenderer in the MB2_MeshCombiner
- Enforces expected structure of CombinedMesh scene object
- Warning when using Unity's texture packer
- better interface for AddDeleteGameObjectsByIDs

======================
Version 2.11.7

- Fixed bug with generating UV2 for multi mesh baker

======================
Version 2.11.6

- Fixed bug where meshes could not be combined if the original meshes had been deleted from the scene
- Added warning if skinned mesh has been optimized.

======================
Version 2.11.5

- Fixed bug where combining skinned meshes did not work correctly
- Fixed bug with validation which required resultMaterial to be set when doing multi material

======================
Version 2.11.4

- Improved update so developer has control over which channels are updated.

======================
Version 2.11.3

- Fixed problem copying normal maps to atlases.

======================
Version 2.11.2

- Better calculation of ideal atlas size.

======================
Version 2.11.1

- Fixes error displaying suggested treatment for overlapping submeshes

======================
Version 2.11

- Removed/fixed lines of code that generated warnings
- Add feature that suggests what can be done if meshes don't bake
- If only one texture in an atlas then original textures are re-used
- Refactored much of the texture combining code

======================
Version 2.10

- Changed the internal representation to store instanceIDs instead of GameObjects
 this makes it possible to remove destroyed objects as long as the ID instance ID is remembered.
- Added a flag to make validation optional.
- Improved UpdateApproximateBounds and added two scripts that can be do this
- Improved the logging class
- Fixes errors when switching the output after a bake
- Added a version field so dependent projects know the version

======================
Version 2.9.1

Fixes a minor issue where a warning is displayed when skinned meshes
contain no meshes.

======================
Version 2.9

Moved all UnityEditor class usage to classes in the Editor folder
To do this an interface MB2_EditorMethodsInterface and class MB2_EditorMethods were created.
Created new Logging class for better debug tracing
There were a number of changes to the API

MB2_MeshCombiner.Apply takes a delegate function for Generating UV2. This should be null when called at runtime and set to Unwrapping.GenerateUV2 when called from the editor.


These methods require an instance of MB2_EditorMethods when called from the editor. The parameter should be null or ommitted when called at runtime.
    doCombinedValidate
    CreateAndSaveAtlases

These methods were moved to MB2_EditorMethods
    SaveMeshsToAssetDatabase 
    RebuildPrefab

======================
Version 2.8.3

Fixed bug where can only create one result material when creating multiple result materials

Fixed bug when baking all bakers in scene if one has no objects

Cleaned up error message when have not created texture bake results

======================
Version 2.8.2

Added Mesh Baker texture packer

Added button to auto generate source to combined material mappings from objects to combine

Changed texture format messages from warnings to info messages

Fixed null pointer exception when baking assets in place

cleaned up code in TextureCombiner

Added Show/Hide to the API which just updates triangles
